## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Port already in use

```bash
# The app runs on port 3000 by default
# If port 3000 is in use, Vite will suggest another port
```

### Dependencies not installing

```bash
# Clear cache and reinstall
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

### Build errors

```bash
# Make sure you're using Node.js 18+
node --version

# Clean and rebuild
npm run build
```

## 📖 Next Steps

1. **Read the full README.md** for detailed architecture information
2. **Explore the code** - start with `src/App.tsx`
3. **Check the API services** in `src/features/*/services/`
4. **Review Redux slices** in `src/features/*/redux/slices/`
5. **Customize the theme** in `src/App.tsx`

## 💡 Tips

- All API calls are mocked using MSW - no backend needed
- Hot reload is enabled - changes appear instantly
- TypeScript strict mode is enabled for better type safety
- Material-UI theme can be customized in `App.tsx`
- Form validation uses Zod schemas
